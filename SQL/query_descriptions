# Queries needed for project:

# Case where new user is added:
-- need to determine what the new user id should be (need to find MAX and add 1)
-- need to INSERT user info into userInfo database
-- need to INSERT user into newWorthInfo table (everything initialized to 0)

# Case where user adds a new entry
-- update the itemsEntered table with INSERT. Indicate with 1 or 0 if it is a liab or asset.
-- update the net worth table (UPATE TABLE)
-- need to return results of the updated netWorthInfo to display it to user (A,L,NW)

# Case where user needs to update an entry
-- UPDATE itemsEntered table (only need to update amount)
-- if item amount is set to $0, need to DELETE that row of the table
-- UPDATE netWorthInfo table (update all)

#SENDING EMAILS TO OTHER USERS
-- will need to get email of other user based on username

NOTES FOR GROUP:
how are we gonna store the user that is logged in?
Do they automatically get logged out when they exit the page?
